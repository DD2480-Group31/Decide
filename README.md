## Program Description: Decide 
Decide is a java class with a method DECIDE() that will generate a boolean signal which determines wheter an interceptor should be launched based upon input radar tracking information. The logic follows the requirements as specified in [this](https://canvas.kth.se/courses/37918/files/6157550/download?wrap=1) document.

## Running:
Requires java version 8 or higher to build the project with Gradle and tests the implemenation with JUnit.
To build and run the tests locally use:
#### ./gradlew build

Running the individual tests can be done in an IDE supporting Gradle test-structure.

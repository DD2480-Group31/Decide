## Program Description: Decide 
Decide is a java class with a method DECIDE() that will generate a boolean signal which determines wheter an interceptor should be launched based upon input radar tracking information. (More details)

## Corollary
What does each exported function do? Only describe DECIDE()? since that is the only callable method for a user?

## Way of working
In what state are you in? Why? What are obstacles to reach the next state?
